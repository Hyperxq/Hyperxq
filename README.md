# Hi, I'm Daniel Ramírez! 🚀

I am deeply passionate about front-end development, particularly within the JavaScript environment. This passion drives my work in front-end development using Angular, React, and Astro. On the backend, I prefer NestJS, and for UI design, Figma holds a special place in my heart ♥️. In my spare time, I dedicate myself to [Project Builder](https://pbuilder.dev/), a tool aimed at helping developers automate code generation. With Project Builder's schematics, you can create complete and complex projects with just a single command line instruction. For more information, check out the [Schematic Docs](https://schematics.pbuilder.dev) and my [Blog Posts](https://medium.com/@hyperxq).

📫 I'm always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and professionals. Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DanielB05817361) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-ram%C3%ADrez-79351ab9/).

Thank you! 😎
